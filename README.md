# Tutorial workspace

*tutorial-workspace*  bundles all the necessary dependencies for building and running SSApps in a single package.

### Core components

The *tutorial-workspace*  bundle contains the following core components required for building and running a Self Sovereign Application:

- Octopus task runner
- Opendsu sdk
- Web Server
- Minimal demo SSApp example
- DSU Explorer

*Octopus*  is the first tool installed by the ssapp-demo-workspace and it is used to further fetch and build the rest of the dependencies. For more information on Octopus read the [OpenDSU dedicated page](https://opendsu.com/rfc095) in the documentation.

The web server is configured to serve static files from the web-server directory inside the *template-workspace* installation. Besides serving static files, the server exposes the Brick Storage API required to store data to EDFS.

DSU Explorer is a web tool for interacting with DSUs (basic features that enable DSU structure viewing and managing).

## Prerequisites

You need the following software installed on your machine in order to continue the this guide

1. Install or update [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (including NPM) to version **>=v18.17.1** .
2. Install or update [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

The only commands you need to run in the *tutorial-workspace* workspace are:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/webcardinal/tutorial-workspace
$ cd tutorial-workspace
$ npm install
$ npm run server
$ npm run build-all
```
Additional steps
```
$ npm run install-explorer
```

A simple and minimal SSApp application is the first thing you can checkout after running the above commands and accessing ```http://127.0.0.1:8080/demo-wallet/loader```. 

### Adding more SSApps

OpenDSU.com has a dedicated document on [how to create a ssapp](https://www.opendsu.org/pages/quickstart/Developers-Tutorial-(RFC-114).html) and that will give you a head start on how to create and add multiple ssapps into your workspace.

## Hello World! DSU Tutorial

This tutorial sub project helps you understand how you can work directly with DSUs.

The code for this tutorial is in [helloworld-dsu] folder. It consist of only one file _main.js_

To **FIRST** run it simply **run the steps** found in the [Installation] section above then:

```sh
# Step 1: Go inside [helloworld-dsu]
cd helloworld-dsu

# Step 2: Run the app
node main.js
```

You should get something like:

To change the port on which the ApiHub listen two files needs to be updated:

 - check and update "apihub-root/external-volume/config/apihub.json" change 8080 to PORT_NUMBER
 - edit the "env.json" add the  "BDNS_ROOT_HOSTS": "http://127.0.0.1:PORT_NUMBER"

It may happen that some versions of node.js resolve localhost to ipv6 instead of ipv4, to resolve this we need to use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost in the env.json file for the BDNS_ROOT_HOSTS key, and in any other place we may need. Also in the browser you need to use the ip address 127.0.0.1 instead of relying on localhost name.
